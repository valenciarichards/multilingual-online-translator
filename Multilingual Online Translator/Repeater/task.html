<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The first step of this project is preparation for a convenient translation process. At this stage, there'll be only two available languages: English and French. The program should suggest to the user to choose the direction of the translation and the word to translate. Then, the confirmation message should be printed.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>At this stage, your program should:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Output the welcoming message: <code class="java">Type "en" if you want to translate from French into English, or "fr" if you want to translate from English into French:</code></li>
	<li>Take an input specifying the target language.</li>
	<li>Output the message: <code class="java">Type the word you want to translate:</code></li>
	<li>Output the confirmation message in the format <code class="java">You chose "language" as a language to translate "word".</code>, where <code class="java">language</code> is either <code class="java">en</code> or <code class="java">fr</code> and <code class="java">word</code> is the word chosen by the user.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Type "en" if you want to translate from French into English, or "fr" if you want to translate from English into French:
&gt; fr
Type the word you want to translate:
&gt; hello
You chose "fr" as the language to translate "hello" to.</code></pre>

<p>We don't really need this output to appear at the end. However, aside from keeping the user informed, it does something else: it's showing us if the arguments were successfully accepted by the function. Keep it in mind while proceeding from stage to stage!</p>
